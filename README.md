# Milla FÃ¶r Helvete

**Note:** This repository contains documents outlining the personal journey for
one of my friends to become a skillful software developer hax0r like my fine
self. If you're not her, this repo will probably be of little use to you, but
you're free to enjoy it anyway!

## Overview

So, first things first; what's the real plan? I thoroughly believe that the
best way to learn something is to just actually do it. To actually want to do
something, one needs a passion project. For us, that passion project will be to
create a simple mini-community for our close circle of friends.

The choice of a web project is almost deliberate, because creating and
maintaining a web site will touch upon almost all technical skills related to
software development:

* Project planning
* Actual writing of code
* Source control
* Deployment and server management
* Design
* Testing
* Databases and storage

...etc.

## Code of conduct

For this to work as smoothly as possible, we need a code of conduct for how we
do things. These codes are applied even before we start working (aka, when
you're reading up) and they can be changed if we just talk about it!

* All communication between us while working on this will be **in English**, even
  if (especially if!) IRL.
* This is a mentor-mentee relationship. As such, **feedback between the two of us
  is paramount**. If you feel that I could improve by changing something, tell me
  as early as possible, and I will do the same.
* We both spend a **minimum of two hours every weekday** on this. You for working,
  me for planning and helping. Extra time put into this is encouraged; we have
  a lot of things to learn!
* **When you start working, message me.** Thusly, I'll be more alert for questions
  from you, and you get the commitment feeling by actually announcing your
  intent to work. You should do this even if you're just reading a bit for 15
  minutes on the train.
* Likewise, when you finish up, **message me and tell me that as well**.
* You are **not allowed to feel stupid**. If you do not understand something,
  that's a reflection upon me that I am not teaching you properly. In the same
  manner, we will let things take the time they need without rushing anything.
* **No questions are stupid**. If you have something you're not able to solve
  yourself within a minute (as in 60 seconds), ask me and I will help. In the
  same manner, you cannot ask too many questions; you can only do the opposite.
* Be as **verbose as possible** at all times. This helps me follow how you think,
  and is actually a valuable skill in day-to-day development as well. It's
  always better to provide more details than not.


## Prerequisites

Before we can start developing, you need some knowledge that you do not yet
possess. Therefore, I have a couple of things you need to read.

* [Learning Python][python]
* [Learning vim][vim]
