# Your first programming language: Python

To be a developer, one needs to know one or more programming languages. The one
I am most prolificent in is Python, so that's the one I will be teaching you
first.

Luckily, there are very good free resources that will teach you Python. The one
we will be using is [Learn Python The Hard Way][lpthw]. It is a very hands-on
book filled with exercises, and it's focused towards those who are not
necessarily developers.

Your first task is a long one: You are to read this book from the Preface to
the very last chapter, and while doing so you are to complete all the
exercises in it. The book covers Python and programming in general in a very
good way. I have not completed all the exercises myself, but I have faith in
the book and it's author.

That's actually it. Get to it!
