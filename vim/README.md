# Your first real editor: vim

When developing, you will edit tons of text files. Not only for your code, but
all the servers you will manage will be configured by different formats of text
files. Luckily, developers are very keen on making sure that the things you do
often are as effective as possible.

Let's not sugarcoat it; vim is very different. If you open notepad or any other
application you edit text with and press "ASDF" on your keyboard, you would
expect "ASDF" to be entered into the file. That's not the case in vim, because
is in a command mode when you start it. All of the keys are mapped to doing
stuff such as deleting lines or moving to specific points in the file.

So, go to [vim.org][vim]. Please don't mind how ugly it is. Go to the downloads
section and download and install the latest version. Once down, start the
`gvimtutor` command and follow the tutorial. It'll take about 30 minutes. You
will not be a master by the end of it, but you will have ironed out the most
confusing things about it.

One of the best things about vim is that some version of it will be installed
on every server you will ever work on. To know that your tool is present is
a very useful thing if you just need to do something quick.
